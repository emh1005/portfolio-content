            <p>The existing webpage of Universal EC Inc.'s Electronic Invoice product page is a static one-page. I introduced UX concepts and elements to this page and redesigned it into an interactive webpage.</p>

            Original Website
			<p>Some of the main pain points of the original website include the lack of distinction of information for different target audiences, complicated explanation of the product, and the lack of call-to-actions.</p>

            Redesigned Wireframe
			<p>The redesign focuses on pointing out the main features and benefits of this product and clear distinction of different target audiences (B2B, B2C, cooperate), as well as a contact page.</p>
