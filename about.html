HELLO!
I'm a full-time bookworm and a part-time designer, but also a podcaster and a web designer/developer. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Interaction Design from University of Washington, and I'm currently working at E.Sun Bank in Taiwan as a UX researcher. I'm passionate about storytelling through different means, be it through video, voice or words. I'm always up for a challenge and learning or trying new things. When I'm not designing or reading, I like traveling, oil painting and photography.
